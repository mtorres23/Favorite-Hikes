What I struggled most with this project was authentication and users. This project was a bit more complex and harder for me to grasp. Although, after going through multiple examples and boilerplates, I beleive I have a better understanding overall. 

ROUTES:
The user has the opportunity to add post of their favorite trails all while being able to edit, update, and delete them.
